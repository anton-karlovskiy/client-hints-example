      <p class="intro-copy"><b>Sconnie Timber</b> is a family-run business that has served central Wisconsin since 1971. Our management is based on the principles of the <a href="http://www.sfiprogram.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Forestry Initiative</a> (SFI), which incorporates sound forestry and Best Management Practices (BMPs) to protect water quality and natural resources. It has been our privilege to work with over 3000 satisfied landowners and we look forward to continuing this tradition for many years to come. Providing proper forest management and a quality logging job is something we take great pride in accomplishing for the landowners we work with.</p>
